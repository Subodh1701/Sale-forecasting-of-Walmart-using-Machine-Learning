# Sale-forecasting-of-Walmart-using-Machine-Learning
Using historical markdown data from the Walmart dataset comprising  45 Walmart locations, a data science project in Python is created to forecast sales for each category.   The goal of this project is to create a prediction model and figure out how much each product sells at a certain Walmart location. The prediction model is largely based on linear regression in this research, which included an exploratory investigation.  Predict which departments will be impacted by the holiday markdown events, as well as the magnitude of the impact.    We'd also like to build a linear model to get a certain number for Weekly Sales that we wish to forecast. This line of best fit is intended to approximate further data points based on the line that we find in our training data. Perform dimensionality reduction to improve prediction error by shrinkage in order to reduce overfitting.
